# No Undo Challenge
Try using your professional software without undoing or get laughed at!

### AutoHotKey is not required to run the executable!

## Why not just unbind the undo shortcut?
Launching a small .exe usually is faster and allows you not to mess with your application's settings.
Also this fabulous program will make fun of you if you fail.
