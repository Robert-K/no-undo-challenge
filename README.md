# No Undo Challenge ðŸš«
Try using your professional software without undoing or get laughed at!

This portable application will prevent you from using Ctrl+Z and play a humiliating sound everytime you press it on accident!

Veery loosely inspired by the OP-1 workflow ;)

### AutoHotkey is not required to run the executable!

## Why not just unbind the undo shortcut?
Launching a small .exe usually is faster and allows you not to mess with your application's settings.
Also this fabulous program will make fun of you if you fail.
